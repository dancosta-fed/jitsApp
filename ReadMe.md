# JitsiMeet App

This is just a test app. Implementing JitsiMeet on React Native.

## Run

npm install
npm start
npx react-native run-ios || npx react-native run-android

### What Have I done

I've added a simple main page with a button to call JitsiMeet. Found no issues on Implementing the iOS version of the app. The Android, on the other hand...

Whenever I click to start a call it opens a black screen and stays on it. Once app is refreshed the call works and it opens JitsiMeet smoothly.

I haven't yet been able to solve the android issue.
